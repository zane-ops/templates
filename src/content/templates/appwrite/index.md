description: 'Appwrite is an end-to-end platform for building Web, Mobile, Native,
  or Backend apps, packaged as a set of Docker microservices. It includes both a backend
  server and a fully integrated hosting solution for deploying static and server-side
  rendered frontends. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required
  to build modern apps from scratch and allows you to build secure, full-stack applications
  faster.

  Using Appwrite, you can easily integrate your app with user authentication and multiple
  sign-in methods, a database for storing and querying users and team data, storage
  and file management, image manipulation, Cloud Functions, messaging, and more services.'
